Because we want to avoid overfitting.  An intuitive way of seeing this is that by randomly dropping units at each iteration, we are actually training an ensemble of models.  This ensemble may be more robust to different scenarios than a single model.\n",

However, at least empirically, it appears that choosing a dropout rate of $0.5$ in the hidden layers and $0.8$ in the input layers works well.  Note that here the term \"dropout rate\" means \"the probability of retention of each node in the layer\".\n",
