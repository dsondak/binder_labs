    "# Lab 3: Working with Amazon Web Services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Date:  Saturday, October 27th 2018\n",

    "The main goal of this lab is to get you up and running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  This lab provides detailed instructions on setting up an AWS instance.  Once you have an instance running, we show you how to connect to the instance from your terminal with some basic Unix commands.  Following this, you are instructed on how to launch an instance with packages pre-installed for deep learning.  Finally, we show you to start a Jupyter notebook from an AWS instance and how to connect to it in a browser.  If time permits, you will be asked to use that instance to do some simple exercises."

AWS has many, many instances for your use, but they come at a price.  To see the pricing of Amazon EC2 instances, refer to this page:  [Amazon EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)."

    "### 3. Login to the Virtual Machine\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "To connect to your Linux instance from a computer running Mac or Linux, you'll specify the `.pem` file to your `SSH` client with the `-i` option and the path to your private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select the instance, and then choose Connect\n",
    "* Execute the `ssh` command from a terminal to login to your virtual machine.  The commandf will be similar to: `ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/harvard_dl-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-188-66-250.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com`\n",
    "* To exit from the instance, just type `exit`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "To connect to your Linux instance from a computer running Windows, you can use either MindTerm or PuTTY. If you plan to use PuTTY, you'll need to install it and use the following procedure to convert the `.pem` file to a `.ppk` file:\n",

    "#### Important\n",
    "Note that even after you exit the terminal, your Amazon instance will still be active.  You **MUST** get in the habit of **stopping** your instance from the EC2 dashboard when you are done working.  If you don't do this, then your instance will continue to run and you will incur charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *stopping* an instance is not the same as *terminating* an instance.  Termination will remove the instance from the dashboard entirely.  Stopping the instance allows you to restart it and use it again."

We didn't get into it, but you can manually install all the packages you want on your instance.  Having said this, it would be really great it there were some instances that came with pre-installed packages for specific computing needs.  AWS has responded to this need and provides instances tailored to specific cases.  In this part, you will launch an instance that has packages for machine learning such as `keras`.\n",
