    "# Lab 1: Building a Neural Network\n",

    "In the first lecture, you were introduced to the basics of neural networks.  In today's lab, you will create a simple neural network build some intuition about how it works.  The basic ideas will be demonstrated with code snippets and exercises.  You will explore the affect of different activation functions, the importance of the neuron weights and biases, and the affect of multiple interacting neurons.\n",

    "First, we import some basic `python` libraries."

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "1. Make sure you clone the current lab.  I may have made last-minute changes.\n",
    "2. You should be able to use `Jupyter` notebooks.  The recommended way of doing this is to install [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).  If you don't have `Anaconda` now and aren't sure how to run a `Jupyter` notebook from your local machine, I have provided an alternative option for you.\n",
    "3. The alternative to running `Jupyter` notebook on your local machine is to use the separate lab repo: [Labs Repo](https://github.com/dsondak/dswcc_fall_2018).  Click on the `Binder` badge.  After a few minutes, you will have a `Jupyter` notebook environment with the current lab running in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `Jupyter` notebooks, you are expected to have some familiarity with `Python`.  I am happy to answer some questions during lab, but I may also refer you to extra reading if it takes us too far away from our current topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Workflow Suggestion\n",
    "From time to time, I will push some last-minute changes to a lab.  I recommend the following workflow:\n",
    "1. Clone the repo before each session.\n",
    "2. Make a copy of the current lab called `Lab1-working.ipynb` and do all your work in the working notebook.\n",
    "3. Whenever I make a last-minute change, you won't run the risk of losing all your lab work."

    "### Some Mathematical Notation\n",
    "Before proceeding, let's learn a more succint way of doing the calculations.  If you have a network with a lot of nodes, then you probably don't want to manually determine the output of each node.  It will take forever.  Instead, you can package the computations up using a more compact notation.  We'll illustrate the ideas with the two-node network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a single input $x$ to a single-layer two-node network.  We can store the weights from each node in a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  Similarly, we can store the biases from each node in a vector $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  The affine transformation is then written as $$\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{w}x + \\mathbf{b}$$ where the usual laws of vector addition and multiplication by a scalar apply.  Of course, we have that $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as well.  Next we evaluate the output from each node.  Formally, we write $$\\mathbf{h} = \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)$$ where, once again, $\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  Moreover, it is *understood* that $\\sigma$ operates on each individual element of $\\mathbf{z}$ separately.  If we denote each component of $\\mathbf{z}$ by $z_{j}, \\ j = 1, 2$ then we can write $$h_{j} = \\sigma\\left(z_{j}\\right), \\quad j = 1, 2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we must do something about the output layer.  Mathematically we write $$y_{out} = \\mathbf{w}_{out} \\cdot \\mathbf{h} + b_{out}$$ where $\\mathbf{w}_{out} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $b_{out} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments on the Implementation\n",
    "Mathematically, this all makes perfect sense.  There is a slight wrinkle when we get to the implementation.  The reason is that $x$ must be stored as a vector (or array) on the computer!  When we do that, we must be very careful in telling the computer how to perform the multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example A\n",
    "Suppose we have just stored three points in $x$ on the computer and store $x$ in an array.  Then we have \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "When we write $\\mathbf{w}x + \\mathbf{b}$ the computer actually doesn't know what multiplication we want to do.  If we treat $x$ as though it has dimension $3 \\times 1$ then simply multiplying $\\mathbf{w}$ by $x$ will result in a dimension mismatch error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example B\n",
    "What if we're at the output of the network?  Then $\\mathbf{h}$ is stored as a $2 \\times \\text{num_points}$ array.  But $\\mathbf{w}_{out}$ is a $2\\times 1$ array!  To get the dot product right, we need to tell the computer to take the dot product on each column.  Here's the situation:\n",

    "In this lab, we built up some intuition for what a neural network is doing.  The following concepts were introduced and illustrated:\n",
    "* Input\n",
    "* Nodes (also called neurons) and layers\n",
    "* Weights and biases\n",
    "* Activation functions\n",
    "* Output / prediction\n",
    "We explored how the outputs of individual nodes are combined to give a final prediction.  The sensitivity of the output on the node weights and biases was illustrated with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should, however, have several lingering questions.  We didn't deeply explore the affect of different activation functions.  Also, there has got to be a better way of tuning the weights.  Randomly trying different weights didn't work so well and a grid search is way too expensive.  Plus, what's the deal with \"deep\" networks?  We played around with the width of a network, but what happens if we start putting nodes next to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Ahead\n",
    "Next time, we will begin to explore some of these ideas.  We will dispense with writing our own neural network code for the time-being.  Instead, we will work with [`keras`](https://keras.io/): \"a high-level neural networks API\".  You will learn how to use `keras` to build bigger networks and how to actually train them using real data."
